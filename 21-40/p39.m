   Project Euler problem 39 - Integer right triangles

    If p is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with integral length 
     sides, {a,b,c}, there are exactly three solutions for p = 120.

    {20,48,52}, {24,45,51}, {30,40,50}

    For which value of p â‰¤ 1000, is the number of solutions maximised?
